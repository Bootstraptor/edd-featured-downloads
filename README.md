# EDD Featured Downloads

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). It's aimed at developers/clients who need to show a list of featured downloads.

1. Provides a template tag so finely-tuned placement of featured downloads in your theme is possible. 
1. Provides a shortcode which will simply list all the featured downloads, without the need to enter any IDs.
1. Provides a simple interface for managing featured downloads in the WordPress admin. A "feature download" checkbox will be added to each download edit/publish screen as well as the quick edit boxes. At a glance you'll also be able to see which downloads have been featured on your website from the main download listing.

In true EDD fashion, hooks are provided for developers to fine tune the HTML if needed.
